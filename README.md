<h1>Exp No 1 :Developing AI Agent with PEAS Description</h1>
<h3>Name: S.JAIGANESH </h3>
<h3>Register Number: 212222240037</h3>


# AIM:
<br>
<p>To find the PEAS description for the given AI problem and develop an AI agent.</p>
<br>

# THEORY
<h3>Vacuum Cleaner Agent:</h3>
<p>Performance Measure: Minimize energy consumption, maximize dirt pick up. Making this precise: one point for each clean square over lifetime of 1000 steps.</p>
<p>Environment: Two squares, dirt distribution unknown, assume actions are deterministic and environment is static(clean squares stay clean).</p>
<p>Actuators: Left, Right, Suck, NoOp.</p>
<p>Sensors: Agent can perceive its location and whether location is dirty</p>

<H3>DESIGN STEPS</H3>
<h3>STEP 1:Identifying the input:</h3>
<p>Location.</p>
<h3>STEP 2:Identifying the output:</h3>
<p>move_left: Moves the agent to the left if it is currently at location "B.". move_right: Moves the agent to the right if it is currently at location "A." suck_dirt: Sucks dirt in the current location if there is dirt present. After sucking dirt, the dirt status in that location is updated to indicate cleanliness. do_nothing: Represents a passive action where the agent remains idle.</p>
<h3>STEP 3:Developing the PEAS description:</h3>
<p>PEAS description is developed by the performance, environment, actuators, and sensors in an agent.</p>
<h3>STEP 4:Implementing the AI agent:</h3>
<p>Clean the room and Search for dirt and Suck it.</p>
<h3>STEP 5:</h3>
<p>Measure the performance parameters: For each cleaning performance incremented, for each movement performance decremented</p>
